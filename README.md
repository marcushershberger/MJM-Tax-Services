# MJM-Tax-Services
Senior Project: An application for securely uploading and viewing tax documents for authenticated users.

Current progress: No UI has been implemented beyond basic HTML, as we are focusing on functionality first. Branch 116 is the current branch we are developing, and there is a lot of work that needs done regarding the directory structure (which includes implementing htaccess files and organizing directories for file types (js, css, etc.).

The live server is currently only available on Indiana Wesleyan's campus due to restrictions on port forwarding.
